2. What is a closure? When would you use one?
Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables. Currying or private functions.

3.
function Node(val, children = []) {
  this.val = val;
  this.children = children;
}

class Node {
  constructor(val, children) {
    this.val = val;
    this.children = children;
  }

}

// No constructor function in arrow functions
const Node = (val, children) => {
  val = val;
  children = children;
}
